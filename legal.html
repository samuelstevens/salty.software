              CONTROLLING HOW OR WHEN OUR USERS USE OUR SERVICES OR THE
              FEATURES, SERVICES, AND INTERFACES OUR SERVICES PROVIDE. WE ARE

              OR INFORMATION (INCLUDING CONTENT) OF OUR USERS OR OTHER THIRD
              PARTIES. YOU RELEASE US, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND OUR AND
              THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, AND AGENTS
              (TOGETHER, THE "TICKETBAY PARTIES") FROM ANY CLAIM, COMPLAINT,

            <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
            <p>
              THE TICKETBAY PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOST
              PROFITS OR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, OR
              INCIDENTAL DAMAGES RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY IN
              CONNECTION WITH OUR TERMS, US, OR OUR SERVICES, EVEN IF THE
              TICKETBAY PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
              DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR
              IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TERMS, US, OR OUR SERVICES WILL
              NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) OR THE AMOUNT
              YOU HAVE PAID US IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS. THE FOREGOING
              DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL
              APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE LAWS
              OF SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
              LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS
              AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
              NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN OUR TERMS, IN SUCH
              CASES, THE LIABILITY OF THE TICKETBAY PARTIES WILL BE LIMITED TO
              THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
            </p>
            <h2>Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
              You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the TicketBay
              Parties from and against all liabilities, damages, losses, and
              expenses of any kind (including reasonable legal fees and costs)
              relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with any
              of the following: (a) your access to or use of our Services,
              including information provided in connection therewith; (b) your
              breach or alleged breach of our Terms; or (c) any
              misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully as
              required by us in the defense or settlement of any Claim.
            </p>
            <h2>Dispute resolution</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Forum and Venue.</strong> If you are a TicketBay user
              located in the United States or Canada, the "Special Arbitration
              Provision for United States or Canada Users" section below applies
              to you. Please also read that section carefully and completely. If
              you are not subject to the "Special Arbitration Provision for
              United States or Canada Users" section below, you agree that you
              will resolve any Claim you have with us relating to, arising out
              of, or in any way in connection with our Terms, us, or our
              Services (each, a "Dispute," and together, "Disputes") exclusively
              in the United States District Court for the First District of Ohio
              or a state court located in Hamilton County in Ohio, and you agree
              to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the
              purpose of litigating all such Disputes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Governing Law.</strong> The laws of the State of Ohio
              govern our Terms, as well as any Disputes, whether in court or
              arbitration, which might arise between TicketBay and you, without
              regard to conflict of law provisions.
            </p>
            <h2>Availability and termination of our services</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Availability of Our Services.</strong> Our Services may be

              your access to or use of our Services anytime for any reason, such
              as if you violate the letter or spirit of our Terms or create
              harm, risk, or possible legal exposure for us, our users, or
              others. The following provisions will survive any termination of
              your relationship with TicketBay: "Licenses," "Disclaimers,"
              "Limitation of Liability," "Indemnification," "Dispute
              Resolution," "Availability and Termination of our Services,"

              PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ADDITIONAL

              IF YOU ARE A TICKETBAY USER LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OR

              ARBITRATION OF ALL DISPUTES, EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT INVOLVE
              INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISPUTES AND EXCEPT THOSE THAT CAN BE
              BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THIS MEANS YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR

              THIS SECTION ALSO LIMITS THE TIME YOU HAVE TO START AN ARBITRATION

              TicketBay and you each agree to waive the right to a trial by
              judge or jury for all Disputes, except for the Excluded Disputes.
              TicketBay and you agree that all Disputes (except for the Excluded
              Disputes), including those relating to, arising out of, or in any
              way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity, will
              be resolved through final and binding arbitration. TicketBay and
              you agree not to combine a Dispute that is subject to arbitration
              under our Terms with a Dispute that is not eligible for
              arbitration under our Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration
              Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect
              at the time the arbitration is started, including the Optional
              Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary
              Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (together, the "AAA
              Rules"). The arbitration will be presided over by a single
              arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. The AAA
              Rules, information regarding initiating a Dispute, and a
              description of the arbitration process are available at
              <a class="in-text" href="https://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>. The
              arbitrator will decide whether a Dispute can be arbitrated. The
              location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs
              for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the
              AAA Rules. Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, we will reimburse you
              for all the AAA administrative fees in Disputes that are subject
              to the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes,
              unless the arbitrator determines that a Dispute was filed for
              purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.

              <strong>Small Claims Court.</strong> As an alternative to
              arbitration, if permitted by your local "small claims" court's
              rules, you may bring your Dispute in your local "small claims"
              court, as long as the matter advances on an individual (non-class)
              basis.

              <strong>Time Limit to Start Arbitration.</strong> We and you agree
              that for any Dispute (except for the Excluded Disputes) we and you
              must commence an arbitration proceeding within one year after the
              Dispute first arose; otherwise, such Dispute is permanently
              barred. This means that if we or you do not commence an
              arbitration within one year after the Dispute first arose, then
              the arbitration will be dismissed because it was started too late.

              provisions above under the caption "Special Arbitration Provision
