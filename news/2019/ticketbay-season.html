            <h2>TicketBay's Season Review</h2>
            <p>Feb 5th, 2019</p>
            <p>
              We've been absolutely astounded by the success of TicketBay in its
              first season, and we owe it all to the users. We have lots of
              plans for the coming months and seasons, and we're excited to
              share them with you!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The four of us were excited to release an app for our fellow
              students, and had very low expectations for our success. We
              thought that if we could help at least one student sell a football
              ticket, then we would have learned an incredible amount and helped
              a Buckeye out. Win-win for everyone involved.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In an incredible turn of events, we had waaay more than 1 person
              sell a ticket. By the end of the season, we had 2700 users, who
              listed nearly 1700 tickets. Throughout the season,
              <em>44 THOUSAND</em> dollars worth of tickets was transferred
              through the app between students.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Clearly, there's a large demand for a service like TicketBay on
              campus. We were amazed by both the amount of people who used the
              app as well as the positive feedback we received. After such a
              successful season, we're certainly going to work more on the app
              and update for the next football season.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We're currently thinking about what improvements we can make to
              the app, and would welcome any feedback from users! Feel free to
